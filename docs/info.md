## How it works

Two-bit comparator with bit0+bit1 being compared to bit2+bit3 (Ex. "00" compared to "10" should cause LED1 to be on).

## How to test

Test combinations of the four inputs following the truth table where LED1 will be on if the first two bits are less than the last two bits,
LED2 will be on if the first two bits are equal to the last two bits, and LED3 will be on if the first two bits are greater than the
last two bits.

## External hardware

3 LED Display.
